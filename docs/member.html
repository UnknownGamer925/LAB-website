            <h1 class="Title1">Our Standards for new members</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.375vw; padding-top: 5.3vw;">Thank you for your interest in joining Lympstone Academy Brass. Whilst we are a training band, our<br> 
                playing standards are good for a band of our nature. In order that you can take part fully in our playing,<br> 
                we would like all those who join us <strong><ins>to be able to read music prior to joining</ins></strong> and, if you have not played a<br> 
                brass instrument before, we would ask that you <strong><ins>have some private tuition outside of the Band before<br> 
                joining in</ins></strong>. Our Band Members use a number of locally based music teachers and we'd be happy to<br> 
                provide recommendations if needed.<br>
                We practise every Saturday from 10am to 12pm in the practice room on Chapel Road, except those<br> 
                Saturdays when we have gigs. We expect members to attend as frequently as they can and notify a<br> 
                committee member of their absances in advance. This is also expected for any Gigs aswell.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="margin-left: 5.3vw; margin-top: 5.3vw;">
            <h1 class="Title1" style="margin-left: 18.23vw;">What do I need?</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 1.375vw; padding-top: 5.3vw;">If you have your own instrument this would be an advantage, because, although we have some spare<br>
                instruments to lend out, they are not always available. If you do not have an instrument, please contact<br> 
                us to see if we have one available for you.<br> 
                When you join us, we will provide you with music and a folder to keep it in. Please bring the music to<br> 
                practices. For gigs, a list of music will be sent out in advance and Band Members are expected to<br> 
                organise their music accordingly. We provide cornet mutes which are kept with us at all times and<br> 
                provided on-site so you do not take them home. Given the younger nature of some of our players, we<br> 
                only use cup mutes. We do not use mutes for other instruments.</p>
